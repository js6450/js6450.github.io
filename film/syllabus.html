        General Course Information

        Instructor:
        Jiwon Shin [ jiwon.shin@nyu.edu ]

        Dates: July 16th – July 21st, 2018

        Course Description

        China has the second-largest film market in the world, with some experts estimating that this growing industry will surpass the American market by 2018. Today, no matter where a film is produced, most movies are shot digitally. If you are considering a career in filmmaking, this program will introduce you to the essential skills needed for advanced study in college. This course will allow you to gain a thorough understanding of the technical aspects of this digital art form including lens usage, light metering techniques, blocking, and professional conventions. You will work in small production crews and share different responsibilities, learning about writing, producing, storyboarding, cinematography, audio recording, and editing. In addition, you will explore how to develop creative concepts and how to capture them digitally—from the first shoot to the final edit. Morning and afternoon sessions will provide hands-on instruction, which will conclude in a showcase screening of your final film. You will shoot outdoors at local venues in Shanghai, gaining valuable experience and a finished digital portfolio piece.

        Please contact me at jiwon.shin@nyu.edu for any questions or concerns that you may have in regard to your assignments and/or final project. All inquiries will be answered within 24 hours.

        Course Expectations

        ·   	Attendance is mandatory. Every class builds off the previous one so it is vital to be present for every lesson. Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact the knowledge gained from this class. If you are going to be late or absent, please email me in advance. If you have an emergency, please let me know as soon as you can.
        ·   	Day 2’s tech Workshop attendance is absolutely mandatory. If you miss a tech workshop, you will not be allowed to use the equipment. There are no exceptions to this.
        ·   	Be prepared to work in groups on the assignments
        ·   	You are expected to present your work in class. Explaining your work to other people is a great way to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself.
        ·   	Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume you understand the material completely.

        Final Project

        The final project is an opportunity to show what you have learned this past week with your new awesome skills. We expect your project to.
        ·   	Involve a specific Shanghai location and should tell us some form of a story about that place. By story, it could be a “How-To” do something there, it could be a story of the people who live/work there, it could be historical, or it could even be a fictional story part of which that happens at that site. Your final project has to have a site-specific component.
        ·   	Only uses footage that was taken by yourself or group members
        ·   	Credited music or any materials that aren’t yours at the end of the video
        ·   	HAVE FUN!
        It is very important that everyone in the group is equally involved in the development of this project. The final project deadline is 12:00 AM, July 15th and should be publish on the Tudou channel.

        Required and Recommended Material

        [Clearly state what students need to bring to participate effectively in the course. Clearly state what, if any, resources will be provided by the faculty and how to access these resources.]

        Grading/Assessment

        ­

        For graded courses, clearly state categories for assessment and weights for each category (e.g., participation = 15%).

        Please keep in mind that attendance is not a quality assessment and so is not a category for assessment. Attendance is a prerequisite to participation in any course. Attendance cannot be used to evaluate the quality of class participation.

        Include multiple modes of assessment:
        When and why do you use quizzes, forums, exams, essays, or presentations?
        What other forms of feedback will you provide for your students?
        Have you included both formative and summative assessments?

        ●  	Formative Assessments include short written assignments, quizzes, one-minute papers, forum posts, blog posts – whatever you use to assess progress and support the learning process. Students expect and deserve ongoing and timely feedback.

        ●  	Summative Assessments include final exams, midterm exams, final papers, projects, and presentations – whatever you use to determine whether the student has accomplished the learning outcomes specified for the course.

        Final Projects: If you assign a final project, please be sure that it serves the course learning outcomes and that you have provided enough scaffolding along the way to make possible successful outcomes.

        Clearly state your policies for missed or late assignments.
